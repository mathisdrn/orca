## Roadmap

### Short Term Plan

- Make an initial version of AGENTS.md and SKILLS.
  - Using [orca-demo], find area where agents are not good or consistent (naming, testing, documentation, code structure, etc).
  - In-depth analysis of what advanced knowledge can be added (eg. recent DuckDB Merge-Upsert that allows for simpler [SCD type II](https://duckdb.org/docs/stable/guides/sql_features/merge))

### Medium Term Plan

- publish as beta (0.1) and get feedback from early users
- support dev/prod environment
- support non-local database
- support DuckLake as storage layer
- define and implement CI/CD strategy
- implement security boundaries for agentic access
- define a process for users to udpate Orca
