# Query & View Gotchas

> **Read this before writing views or queries.** These patterns cause most query errors.

## Charts: ONE Aggregate Per View

Charts render only the **first** aggregate. Use exactly one aggregate per `# bar_chart` / `# line_chart` view.

```malloy
// WRONG: revenue is ignored
# bar_chart
view: x is { group_by: status, aggregate: order_count, revenue }
// RIGHT: single aggregate
# bar_chart
view: x is { group_by: status, aggregate: revenue }
```

For multiple metrics: nest separate chart views in a `# dashboard`, or use `y=['revenue','cost']` for multi-measure series.

## Joined Fields in `order_by`: Must Alias First

```malloy
// WRONG: compile error
view: x is { group_by: races.season_year, aggregate: pts, order_by: races.season_year }
// RIGHT: alias then reference
view: x is { group_by: yr is races.season_year, aggregate: pts, order_by: yr }
```

Any time you `group_by` a joined field, create an alias and use it in `order_by`.

## `having:` vs `where:`: Aggregate Filters

```malloy
// WRONG: "Aggregate expressions not allowed in where"
view: x is { group_by: cat, aggregate: n is count(), where: n > 10 }
// RIGHT
view: x is { group_by: cat, aggregate: n is count(), having: n > 10 }
```

- `where:` filters rows BEFORE aggregation (dimensions/raw columns)
- `having:` filters AFTER aggregation (measures)

## Aggregating Joined Fields: Method Syntax

```malloy
// WRONG: compile error: "Join path is required for this calculation; use 'inventory_items.item_cost.sum()'"
measure: cogs is sum(inventory_items.item_cost)
// RIGHT: method syntax
measure: cogs is inventory_items.item_cost.sum()
```

`sum`, `avg`, `min`, and `max` over a dotted joined path all produce that compile error; the diagnostic message even tells you the exact fix. Don't worry about catching this in code review; the compiler does it for you.

**Exception: `count(joined.field)` is correct, not a bug.** `count(joined.field)` is the **canonical Malloy idiom** for distinct-count through a join. Keep it as-is even when nearby `sum`/`avg`/`min`/`max` calls have to use method syntax. The closest method-syntax form `joined.count()` counts *rows* in the joined source (different semantics, differs from the distinct count when the joined field has duplicates within the joined table). The Malloy docs example `joined.count(field)` does NOT compile against current Malloy (error: `Expression illegal inside path.count()`); it only works for double-nested paths like `aircraft.count(aircraft_models.code)`.

## Chart Annotation Placement

Place `# bar_chart` / `# line_chart` on the **nested view definition**, not on `nest:` itself. Putting it on `nest:` causes "not a repeated record" errors.

## DRY: Define in Source, Reference in View

```malloy
// WRONG: inline in view
view: summary is { aggregate: revenue is sum(total) }
// RIGHT: reference existing measure
view: summary is { aggregate: revenue }
```

## Time Truncation vs Extraction

| Syntax | What it does | Returns |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| `ts.month` | Truncates to start of month | Timestamp (`@2024-03-01`) |
| `month(ts)` | Extracts month number | Integer (1-12) |
| `ts.year` | Truncates to start of year | Timestamp (`@2024-01-01`) |
| `year(ts)` | Extracts year number | Integer (2024) |

Use `.month` for time series charts (proper date ordering). Use `month()` for cross-year comparison.

**Year integers render with commas.** `year(ts)` displays as `2,018`. Tag with `# number=id` to suppress commas. Same for zip codes, IDs.

## `?` Alternation: Use Commas to Combine Filters

The `?` operator is Malloy's **alternation operator**: a shorthand for "match any of these values." `party ? 'Democrat' | 'Republican'` means `party = 'Democrat' OR party = 'Republican'`. The `|` separates the alternatives.

When combining an alternation filter with other filters, **use a comma**:

```malloy
// CANONICAL: commas separate independent filter conditions
where: is_us = true, party ? 'Democrat' | 'Republican'
```

`and` works in some arrangements (when the alternation is the second operand) but produces a confusing `'logical operator' Can't use type string` compile error when the alternation comes first. The comma form is unambiguous in every position, so just use it.

## Query Clauses Are Newline-Separated

Do not use trailing commas between query clauses. Each clause goes on its own line.

```malloy
// WRONG: trailing comma before limit
run: source -> { group_by: status, aggregate: n is count(), limit: 10 }
// RIGHT: newline-separated
run: source -> {
  group_by: status
  aggregate: n is count()
  limit: 10
}
```

Clauses: `group_by:`, `aggregate:`, `nest:`, `order_by:`, `limit:`, `where:`, `having:`, `select:`, `calculate:`
