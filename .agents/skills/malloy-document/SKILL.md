# Documenting a Malloy Model

Add `#(doc)` tags to describe sources and fields in plain language so they are easy to find and understand:

| Tag | Purpose | Goes on |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `#(doc)` | Plain-language description for natural-language search | source, dimension, measure, view, join |
| `#(filter)` | Declare a parameterizable filter (runtime/modeling concern, see `malloy-model`) | source |

`#(doc)` is a standard Malloy annotation. It documents a field or source with a human-readable description that downstream tools can surface and search against.

## #(doc) Tag

Add before any source, dimension, measure, view, or join. When multiple fields share a keyword, use it once as a block header. Tags and field names are indented under the keyword; tags go on the line(s) directly above the field they annotate.

**Tag ordering** (when a field has multiple tags): `#(doc)` → render tags (`# currency`, `# label`, etc.) → field name. Separate each field group with a blank line:

```malloy
#(doc) Customer who placed the order
join_one: users with user_id

dimension:
  #(doc) Date the order was placed (UTC)
  order_date is created_at::date

measure:
  #(doc) Total revenue from all orders in USD
  # currency
  revenue is sum(total)
```

### Writing Doc Strings for Retrieval

Doc strings power natural-language search: users type plain-English questions and the system matches against your `#(doc)` strings. Write descriptions that match how analysts would search:

- **Include business meaning**, not code mechanics: what it represents, not how it's implemented
- **Include units** (USD, count, percentage) and valid values for categorical fields
- **Avoid Malloy jargon**: never use "filterable", "groupable", "dimension", "measure", "aggregation"

**Good examples:**
- `#(doc) Total revenue from completed orders in USD` matches "what was our revenue?"
- `#(doc) Customer signup date (UTC)` matches "when did the customer join?"
- `#(doc) Order status: pending, processing, shipped, delivered, cancelled` matches "what are the order statuses?"

**Bad examples:**
- `#(doc) Filterable dimension for order status`: no analyst searches for "filterable"
- `#(doc) Groupable by region`: "groupable" is a system concept
- `#(doc) Aggregation of total sales`: "aggregation" doesn't match natural queries

## #(filter): see `malloy-model`

`#(filter)` is also a `#(...)`-shaped annotation, but unlike `#(doc)` it's a **runtime/modeling construct**: it shapes governance, query latency, and correctness, not discoverability. The full reference (syntax, filter types, `required` / `implicit` flags, and when each applies) lives in `malloy-model` § Parameterizable Filters with `#(filter)` alongside the other source-authoring constructs.

One rule worth knowing here: filters live on the source, never on the consumer. Ad-hoc reports and notebooks that import a source inherit its filters automatically; they do not (and cannot) declare new ones.

## `internal:` and `private:`: column-level access in a source

`#(doc)` describes what's exposed. Two access modifiers control what's exposed in the first place, and both live **inside** a source's `include {}` block. They are about the source's public API and data sensitivity, not about documentation, so reach for them when curating which columns callers can pick.

| Mechanism | Layer | Why you reach for it |
|---|---|---|
| `internal:` | Inside a source (one column in `include {}`) | The column **isn't part of your model's public API**. Common reasons: data is messy (empty/garbage, raw JSON, duplicates), or a documented derived dimension already supersedes it, or the raw column exists only to be joined on / referenced internally and shouldn't appear as a dimension callers can pick. The data may be perfectly fine, it's just not what you want exposed. |
| `private:` | Inside a source (one column in `include {}`) | The **data is sensitive**: SSN, raw credit card, password. Governance / security concern; a harder block than `internal:`. |

In one sentence: **`internal:` and `private:` shape what's inside a source's public API; `#(doc)` describes the fields you do expose.**

### Example

A base source pulled from a messy raw table often uses `internal:` to drop raw fields from the public API, while documenting the curated columns with `#(doc)`.

```malloy
// orders_base.malloy
#(doc) Raw orders. Use orders.malloy as the entry point for analysis.
source: orders_base is conn.table('orders_raw')
  include {
    public: id, customer_id, order_date, total
    internal: raw_json_payload, deprecated_status_code, _temp_dedup_marker
  }
  extend {
    primary_key: id
  }
```

```malloy
// orders.malloy
import "orders_base.malloy"

#(doc) Order analysis. Use for revenue, fulfillment, and customer-order joins.
source: orders is orders_base extend {
  // joins, measures, curated dimensions
}
```

The base source stays fully queryable (`run: orders_base -> { ... }` still works); `internal:` only governs which columns appear as public dimensions callers can pick.

## Annotating Columns in Include (Experimental)

With `##! experimental.access_modifiers`, you can add `#(doc)` tags to raw table columns inside `include` blocks. This documents columns without redefining them as dimensions.

```malloy
##! experimental.access_modifiers

source: orders is conn.table('orders') include {
  public:
    #(doc) Order line item identifier
    id

    #(doc) Customer email address
    email

    #(doc) Order status: pending, shipped, delivered
    status

  // internal: only for verified noise (empty cols, raw JSON blobs, duplicates)
}
extend {
  // ... dimensions and measures
}
```

**When to use:**
- Documenting raw columns without creating explicit dimensions
- Curating which columns are public vs internal

## Source-Level Documentation

Document **when to use** a source, not what it contains. Dimensions and measures can already be searched directly, so the source-level `#(doc)` should describe what questions/analyses this source answers.

**Base source files:** Document what the table represents.
```malloy
#(doc) Customer records with demographics and segmentation. One row per customer.
source: customers is conn.table('sales.customers') extend { ... }
```

**Source files:** Document what analytical questions the source answers.
```malloy
#(doc) Customer health analysis. Use for retention, segmentation, churn risk, and lifetime value. For order-level analysis, use order_analysis instead.
source: customer_health is customers extend { ... }
```

**Best practices:**
- Add `#(doc)` to all base source and joined source definitions
- Base source docs: describe what the table is (one row per what)
- Source docs: describe what questions/analyses the source answers
- Documentation happens per-source-file, not in one monolithic file

## Flag Ambiguous Descriptions

After writing `#(doc)` tags, present any that required judgment to the user for confirmation:

| Field | Proposed doc | Confidence | Uncertainty |
|-------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| `total` | "Total order amount in USD" | Medium | Could be gross or net, verified with sample query |
| `status` | "Order status: pending, shipped, delivered" | High | Values confirmed via a query of distinct values |

Only flag fields where the description required assumptions about business meaning, units, or valid values. When in doubt about valid values, run a quick query against the data to confirm them before writing the description. Use `malloy_modelGetText` (or `malloy_packageGet` to see what is in the package) to read the model and `malloy_executeQuery` to check distinct values, for example `run: source -> { group_by: status }`.

## Done

Step complete. Output: `#(doc)` tags added to all public fields and sources.
