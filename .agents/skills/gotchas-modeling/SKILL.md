# Modeling Gotchas

> **Read this before writing Malloy code.** These patterns cause most modeling errors.

## Reserved Words: Backtick Them

**When in doubt, backtick it.** Unquoted reserved words cause cascading errors on unrelated lines.

```malloy
// WRONG                        // RIGHT
dimension: d is Date::date      dimension: d is `Date`::date
```

Words most likely to appear as column names:
```
date, time, day, month, year, quarter, week, hour, minute, second,
number, string, boolean, type, table, source, index, count, sum, avg, min, max,
true, false, null, is, on, with, all, from, by, in, to, for, select, order_by,
top, bottom, desc, asc, row, range, current, window, rank
```

- `number`: only the bare word needs backticking; `account_number` is fine
- `source`: reserved; use a different alias like `traffic_source`

## NULL Checks: `is not null`, NOT `!= null`

```malloy
// WRONG                             // RIGHT
dimension: is_sold is sold_at != null   dimension: is_sold is sold_at is not null
```

## Date Functions vs Properties

```malloy
// WRONG: day_of_week is a function        // RIGHT
dimension: dow is created_at.day_of_week   dimension: dow is day_of_week(created_at)
```

**Property access:** `.month`, `.year`, `.quarter`, `.day`, `::date`
**Function call required:** `day_of_week()`, `week()`, `hour()`, `minute()`, `second()`

## Safe Division: Always `nullif`

```malloy
// WRONG              // RIGHT
a / b                 a / nullif(b, 0)
```

## String Columns Need Casts for Aggregates

```malloy
// WRONG: "Can't use type string"     // RIGHT
measure: avg_score is avg(score)      measure: avg_score is avg(score::number)
```

## Boolean Columns: No Quotes

```malloy
// WRONG                                     // RIGHT
count() { where: complaint = 'true' }        count() { where: complaint = true }
```

Check schema: if `BOOL`, use `true`/`false`. If `STRING`, use `'true'`/`'false'`.

## Field Management: `extend {}` vs `include {}` Don't Compose

Malloy has two field-management mechanisms for base sources. **`include {}` is the curated default; `extend { except / accept / rename }` is the fallback when a `rename:` is unavoidable.** They have different capabilities and **do not combine**.

| Mechanism | Where it lives | Keywords | Compatible with `rename:`? | Experimental flag? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Access modifiers (default) | `include {}` | `public:` / `internal:` / `private:` | **No** | Yes (`##! experimental.access_modifiers`) |
| Field management (fallback) | `extend {}` | `accept:` / `except:` / `rename:` | Yes (same block) | No |

### Default: `include {}` for documented, curated base sources

Use `include {}` whenever the source doesn't need a `rename:`. It's the only way to attach `#(doc)` tags to raw columns, and it's the canonical way to hide empty/garbage/duplicate columns (`internal:`) and sensitive ones (`private:`). See `skill:malloy-model` (reference/access-modifiers.md).

```malloy
##! experimental.access_modifiers
source: orders is conn.table('orders') include {
  public:
    #(doc) Order identifier
    order_id

    #(doc) Customer who placed the order
    user_id

  internal:
    raw_payload_json    // empty after JSON extraction
    legacy_status_code  // superseded by status_code
}
```

### When `rename:` is unavoidable: fall back to `extend {}`

`include {}` does not compose with `rename:`. The combination errors with `Can't find field 'X' to set access modifier` because `rename:` runs first and leaves no `X` for `include` to attach a modifier to. There's also a collision inside `include {}` itself: a measure cannot share a name with a raw column, even one tagged `internal:` (`Cannot redefine 'X'`), and the natural fix for that is `rename:`, which then triggers the first error.

When a rename is genuinely required (most often during `conn.sql()` to `conn.table()` migration where a SQL alias matches a measure name that's already in heavy use downstream), drop `include {}` and curate the source with `extend { except: ... }` + `rename:` instead. You forfeit `#(doc)` on raw columns and the `public/internal/private` tiers, but keep column gating and the rename.

```malloy
// RIGHT: rename is required to free `revenue` for the measure
extend {
  except: legacy_status_code   // hide garbage column without include {}
  rename: raw_revenue is revenue
  measure: revenue is raw_revenue.sum()
}
```

If you can rename the measure or split the source instead, prefer that: it preserves `include {}` and the curated surface.

### `extend {}` clauses (reference)

- **`accept:`**: allow-list, keep only the named columns
- **`except:`**: deny-list, drop the named columns; keep everything else (mutually exclusive with `accept:`)
- **`rename:`**: alias a raw column to free up its original name for a measure or dimension

### Migrating `conn.sql()` to `conn.table()` + Malloy clauses

The biggest reason teams reach for `conn.sql()` is column gating, aliasing, and per-row derivation in one place. All three have native equivalents:

1. **Verify the schema**: `run: <source> -> { select: *; limit: 1 }` to discover all columns. Anything in the table but not in the SQL's `SELECT` was being intentionally hidden, so preserve that gating.
2. Switch to `conn.table('…')`.
3. Hidden columns: preferably `include { internal: ... }` (lets you also `#(doc)` the public columns). If a `rename:` is also needed in the same source, fall back to `extend { except: ... }`.
4. SQL aliases: `extend { rename: ... }` (forces the fallback path, since `rename:` and `include {}` don't compose). If the alias was to free up a name for a measure, use `rename: raw_X is X`, then `measure: X is raw_X.sum()`.
5. SQL derivations: `dimension:` definitions in `extend {}`.
6. SQL `WHERE`: source-level `where:`.

## Cannot Redefine Query-Based Source Columns

Columns from `table -> { group_by, aggregate }` or `conn.sql()` already exist. You cannot re-declare them.

```malloy
// WRONG: "Cannot redefine 'user_id'"
source: facts is conn.table('t') -> { group_by: user_id, aggregate: total is sum(amt) }
  extend { dimension: user_id is user_id }
// RIGHT: add only NEW derived dimensions
source: facts is conn.table('t') -> { group_by: user_id, aggregate: total is sum(amt) }
  extend { dimension: is_high_value is total > 1000 }
```

To add `#(doc)` tags to existing query columns, use `include {}` between the query and extend.

## Never Use `conn.sql()` When Malloy Has a Native Pattern

```malloy
// WRONG: raw SQL for pre-aggregation
source: facts is conn.sql("""SELECT user_id, SUM(amount) AS total FROM orders GROUP BY user_id""")
// RIGHT: Malloy query-based source
source: facts is conn.table('orders') -> { group_by: user_id, aggregate: total is sum(amount) }
```

**Mandatory: call `malloy_searchDocs` before reaching for `conn.sql()`.** Don't argue from intuition. Most patterns that look SQL-only have a Malloy equivalent, including the ones reviewers historically said couldn't be expressed.

| Looks like it needs SQL | Malloy equivalent |
|---|---|
| Multi-CTE pipeline | Stacked query-based sources: `source: a is t -> {...}`; `source: b is a -> {...}`; `source: c is b -> {...}` |
| UNNEST / array column access | `array_column.each.field`: arrays auto-join as nested tables ([data types docs](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/language/datatypes#array-access)) |
| PIVOT (conditional aggregation) | Filtered aggregates: `aggregate: a is x.sum() { where: cat = 'a' }, b is x.sum() { where: cat = 'b' }` |
| Window functions (any frame, including custom) | `calculate:` with `sum_cumulative`, `lag`, `lead`, `rank`, `row_number`, `avg_moving`, `first_value`, `last_value`: supports `partition_by:` and `order_by:` ([window functions docs](https://docs.malloydata.dev/documentation/language/functions#window-functions)) |
| `ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND 1 PRECEDING` | `sum_cumulative(x) - x` (cumulative-including-current minus current = cumulative-excluding-current) |
| `WHERE date = (SELECT max(date) FROM …)` (latest snapshot) | `join_cross` to a one-row aggregate source, then filter on the joined `max_date` field |
| Multi-key joins | `join_one: x is target on a = x.a and b = x.b and c = x.c` |
| `greatest()` / `least()` / `CASE` chains | All native: `greatest(a, b, c)`, `least(a, b)`, `pick 'x' when cond else 'y'` |
| Dialect-specific scalar functions | `function_name!return_type(args)`: Malloy's raw-SQL function escape (no `conn.sql()` block needed) |

**Genuinely valid `conn.sql()` candidates (rare):**

- SQL features Malloy explicitly doesn't model (e.g., DML/DDL, specific `MERGE` patterns)
- Multi-stage transformations where every CTE has 3+ joins to different tables AND the result is consumed by multiple downstream sources, but in this case an intermediate table in the data warehouse is usually still better than `conn.sql()`

**Never use `conn.sql()` for:** simple column selection or renaming, `WHERE` filters, two-table joins, column type casts, latest-snapshot patterns, conditional aggregation, or window functions of any kind.

If a project's standards file specifies a stricter policy (e.g., a `malloy_searchDocs` rationale comment requirement above every `conn.sql()` block), defer to that.

## Duplicate Rows: Check Before Building Measures

```malloy
run: source -> { group_by: pk_field, aggregate: n is count(), having: n > 1, limit: 10 }
```

Symptoms: `sum()` returns astronomical values. Causes: event tables, batch retries, merged sources.

## `except:` Removes Fields From Namespace Entirely

`except:` in `include {}` completely removes fields: dimensions and measures cannot reference excluded fields. Use `internal:` instead when derived dimensions need the raw column.

```malloy
// WRONG: dimension references excluded field
source: x is conn.table('t')
include { except: raw_date }
extend { dimension: order_date is raw_date::date }  // ERROR! raw_date is gone

// RIGHT: internal fields are still available in extend
source: x is conn.table('t')
include { internal: raw_date }
extend { dimension: order_date is raw_date::date }  // Works
```

## Source Order: Define Joined Tables First

Malloy compiles top-to-bottom. Define lookup/dimension tables before the source that joins them, or use `import` statements in multi-file projects.

## MUST Search Docs Before Using Unfamiliar Patterns

Call `malloy_searchDocs` BEFORE first use of any of these. Don't guess the syntax:
- `pick` expressions
- Window functions (`calculate`)
- `percentile` or statistical functions
- Time interval functions (`days()`, `seconds()`)
- Query-based sources (`from()`)
- `!` operator / `sql_number()`
